Context: the patient, and his or her overall health. Most fevers
caused by infections are acute, appearing suddenly and
then dissipating as the immune system defeats the infec-
tious agent. An infectious fever may also rise and fall
throughout the day, reaching its peek in the late after-
noon or early evening. A low-grade fever that lasts for
several weeks is associated with autoimmune diseases
such as lupus or with some cancers, particularly
leukemia and lymphoma.
Diagnosis

A very high fever in a small child can trigger
seizures (febrile seizures) and therefore should be treated
immediately. A fever accompanied by the above symp-
toms can indicate the presence of a serious infection,
such as meningitis, and should be brought to the imme-
diate attention of a physician.
Prognosis
Most fevers caused by infection end as soon as the
immune system rids the body of the pathogen and do not
produce any lasting effects. The prognosis for fevers

other conditions can induce a fever, including allergic
reactions; autoimmune diseases; trauma, such as breaking
a bone; cancer; excessive exposure to the sun; intense

Context: diabetes symptoms include isoniazid, nicotinic acid,
cimetidine, and heparin.
Symptoms
Symptoms of diabetes can develop suddenly (over
days or weeks) in previously healthy children or adoles-
cents, or can develop gradually (over several years) in
overweight adults over the age of 40. The classic symp-
toms include feeling tired and sick, frequent urination,
excessive thirst, excessive hunger, and weight loss.
Ketoacidosis, a condition due to starvation or

In Type II diabetes, the pancreas may produce
enough insulin, however, cells have become resistant to
the insulin produced and it may not work as effectively.
Symptoms of Type II diabetes can begin so gradually that
a person may not know that they have it. Early signs are
lethargy extreme thirst, and frequent urination. Other
symptoms may include sudden weight loss, slow wound
healing, urinary tract infections, gum disease, or blurred
vision. It is not unusual for Type II diabetes to be detect-

glucose in the blood cannot be absorbed into the cells of
the body. Symptoms include frequent urination, lethargy,
excessive thirst, and hunger. The treatment includes
changes in diet, oral medications, and in some cases,
daily injections of insulin.

Context: at all during a six-hour period
• dizziness, listlessness, or excessive thirst occur
• a person who is dieting and using diuretics loses more
than 3 lb (1.3 kg) in a day or more than 5 lb (2.3 kg) a
week
When treating dehydration, the underlying cause
must also be addressed. For example, if dehydration is
caused by vomiting or diarrhea, medications may be pre-
scribed to resolve these symptoms. Patients who are
dehydrated due to diabetes, kidney disease, or adrenal

of dehydration. So are staying in the sun too long, not
drinking enough fluids, and visiting or moving to a warm
region where it doesn’t often rain. Alcohol,caffeine, and
diuretics or other medications that increase the amount of
fluid excreted can cause dehydration.
Reduced fluid intake can be a result of:
• appetite loss associated with acute illness
• excessive urination (polyuria)
• nausea
• bacterial or viral infection or inflammation of the phar-
ynx (pharyngitis)

ness and die.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis should be suspected in any patient with
sudden increased thirst and urination. Laboratory exami-
nation of urine will reveal very dilute urine, made up
mostly of water with no solute. Examination of the blood
will reveal very concentrated blood, high in solute and
low in fluid volume.
A water deprivation test may be performed. This test
requires a patient to stop all fluid intake. The patient is
weighed just before the test begins, and urine is collected

Few symptoms in medicine present such a diagnos-

fully searched for important clues.
Usually the first step is to search for an infectious
cause. Skin and other screening tests for diseases such as

Context: watery diarrhea . The most characteristic symptoms of
the illness are those involving the nervous system. These
include numbness and tingling around the lips, tongue,
and mouth; itching ; dry mouth ; metallic taste in the
mouth; and blurry vision. In more prominent cases,
patients may complain of temporary blindness, a slow
pulse, and a feeling that their teeth are loose. Patients
may also have the strange symptom of reversal of hot and
cold sensations on the skin, where cold things feel very

standing), or a darkening/decrease in urination are sug-
gestive. Severe dehydration leads to changes in the
body’s chemistry and could become life-threatening.
Dehydration from diarrhea can result in kidney failure,
neurological symptoms, arthritis, and skin problems.
Diagnosis
Most cases of acute diarrhea never need diagnosis or
treatment, as many are mild and produce few problems.
But patients with fever over 102°F (38.9°C), signs of
dehydration, bloody bowel movements, severe abdomi-

serious complications: For instance, trouble breathing or
swelling in the legs could indicate congestive heart fail-
ure. Headache, joint pain, blood in the urine, or stroke
symptoms could indicate an embolus, and fever and
chills could indicate that the treatment is not working and
the infection is worsening. Finally,diarrhea, rash, itch-
ing, or joint pain may suggest a bad reaction to the
antibiotics. Anyone experiencing any of these symptoms
should alert the health care team immediately.

caused by infections are acute, appearing suddenly and
